* Rename Application class.  Too confusing.
* Make sure logging works across the board.
* Find ORM.
* Make sure ORM still works well with metadata tags.
* Try fun run of metadata routes (declare controllers namespace like SWIZ?)
* Add helper to require a route has permission?  (ie callback to a handler first that allows user to confirm?)
* Support more of HTTP than 2 lines...
